you can get into your vehicle remotely
without reaching for your key fob.
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.320

The second and third row seats in your
Transit Connect wagon can be folded down

when you need extra space for
transporting cargo.
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.050
Here's how to do it.
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.640

first push down the head restraints, like this.
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.793

the seat back closest to the door, here.

Your vehicle also has
something called side sensing.
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.550
It's an enhancement to your forward and
reverse sensing systems that uses a chime
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.420
and a visual diagram display on your
touchscreen with red, yellow, and green
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.160
highlights to indicate where the closest
object to your vehicle is detected.
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.880
Red indicates the closest,
and green the farthest away.

Let me explain, adaptive steering with
tow/haul mode, changes the ratio between
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.570
the driver's actions with the steering
wheel, meaning how much the driver
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.630
turns the steering wheel, and
how much the front wheels actually turn.
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
At slower speeds, this allows
the front wheels to fully turn,
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.520
with fewer rotations
of the steering wheel,
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.980
which is helpful when performing
low speed maneuvers like parking.
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.280
When traveling at higher speeds,
on a highway for
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.500
instance, this feature further
optimizes the steering response,
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.235
enabling the vehicle to react more
precisely to driver input and
00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.065

First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.960
For best results, it's recommended to use
a draw bar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.600
drop to position your trailer level to
the ground. Then line up your vehicle and
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.360
trailer by pulling forward, so
they're in line with one another.
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.994
Second, from inside the vehicle
to begin programming,
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:56.797
press the center of the Pro Trailer Backup
Assist button located to the right of
00:00:56.797 --> 00:00:58.569
the steering wheel, here.
00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.792
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:06.612
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:08.489
Press OK once finished.
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:11.508
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:16.095
Electric, which is the default or
surge type and press OK.
00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:18.751
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer.
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.737
Low, which is the recommended setting for
most trailers,
00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:25.892
Medium or High if your trailer requires
more aggressive braking like if you have
00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:29.230
a larger, heavier trailer, for instance.
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.586
And since Pro Trailer Backup Assist is not
currently compatible with fifth-wheel or
00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:37.592
gooseneck type trailers, conventional
will be the default trailer type.
00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:41.507
You'll get a message asking if you
want to add Pro Trailer Backup Assist.
00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:43.224
Select Yes to confirm.
00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:45.864
A prompt will direct you
to straighten the trailer,
00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:47.725
if necessary to continue the setup.
00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:51.208
You'll then get another message directing
you to put the vehicle in park and

In order to convert the 40 amp
relays to key off battery use,
00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:50.565
there are a few steps you'll need to take.
00:00:50.565 --> 00:00:53.995
First, you'll need to locate
the relay box under the engine hood,
00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:56.015
next to the driver side fender, here.
00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:00.950
Then remove the relay cover by
pressing the tab and lifting it off.
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.060
Next, locate the five amp fuse.
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.900
You'll then need to pull it out,
slide the spacer over, and place it so
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.740
the left prong is in the far left slot and
the right prong is in the middle slot.
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.900
Replace the cover and your 40 amp circuits
are now set to run on battery power

Did you know that you can equip
a trailer with a feature that allows
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.876
your vehicle to monitor and
provide a warning if the tires of
00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:13.350
a trailer that you're towing
are significantly underinflated?
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.850
Let me explain.
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.140
If one or more tires of a connected
trailer become underinflated,
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.120
the trailer tire pressure monitoring
system, or TPMS, will display
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.670
a pop-up warning in your instrument
display indicating which tire is low.

First, keep in mind that
convertible top fabric
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.710
does not promote mildew growth itself.
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.705
Mildew may develop on dirt or
other foreign substances if not removed.
00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:25.090

regular washings will enhance the life and
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.696

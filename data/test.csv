Before you begin you'll need a few
things to help with the set up.
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.425
Your supplied quick start set up guide
with measurement card, a tape measure,
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.408
a pen or pencil, and
an assistant to help out if needed.
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.308
As well as the checkered stickers
that comes with your guide
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.915
which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030
Then, line up the vehicle and
trailer by pulling forward so
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
they're in line with one another.
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
Second, from inside the vehicle, use
the five-way steering wheel controls and
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.030
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
Press OK to confirm.
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.842
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.260
Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850

your trailer: Low,

which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815
heavier trailer for instance, you will
then need to select a trailer type.

Before you begin you'll need a few
things to help with the set up.
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.425
Your supplied quick start set up guide
with measurement card, a tape measure,
00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.408
a pen or pencil, and
an assistant to help out if needed.
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.308
As well as the checkered stickers
that comes with your guide
00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.915
which I'll tell you about later.
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.985
First, you'll need to connect your vehicle
to your trailer on a level surface.
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.105
For best results, it's recommended to use
a drawbar with the appropriate rise or
00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.025
drop to position your
trailer level to the ground.
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.030
Then, line up the vehicle and
trailer by pulling forward so
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.270
they're in line with one another.
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.330
Second, from inside the vehicle, use
the five-way steering wheel controls and
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
go to the Towing menu, and select Trailer
Setup, then Add Trailer, and hit OK.
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.940
Using the up and down and left and right
arrows of the five-way controls, spell out
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.030
the name of the trailer using the right
arrow to advance to the next letter.
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
Press OK to confirm.
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.842
Next, select the type of brake system for
your trailer.
00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:17.260
Electric/Surge is the default,
then press OK.
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850
Now, select the brake effort for
your trailer: Low,
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.190
which is the recommended setting for
most trailers, Medium, or High.
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.770
If your trailer requires more aggressive
braking, like if you have a larger,
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.815
heavier trailer for instance, you will
then need to select a trailer type.
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.346
And since automatic features are only
available with conventional trailers
00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:41.288

Your vehicle has a capless fuel filler

keeps your hands cleaner.
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.010
There's no cap to twist off and
it's simple to use.
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.510
Just open your fuel door by either
putting a finger under the exposed tab
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.530
on the door.
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.780

If you're using a portable fuel container,

provided with your vehicle to avoid
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.470
damaging the seals on
the spring loaded flaps.

And one more thing, to help protect

If no, BLIS turns off.
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.960
If yes, you'll be asked if the trailer is
less than nine feet wide and 33 feet long.

Can these seat backs be folded down?
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.150
&gt;&gt; Can I fold down just one side?
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320
&gt;&gt; Did you know that you
can fold down one or
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.780
both of the rear seat
backs in your vehicle?
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.680
And that's helpful when carrying
longer items like skis or golf bags.
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.740
Here's how to do it.
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.110
Find the release on top of the seat
back you want to fold down.
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.715
Then, just push or pull up to release
the seat back and fold it down.
00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:35.235
Do the same thing on the other side
if you want to fold them both down.
00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.175
You'll get a full pass through
from the trunk that way.
00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:42.601
And for your convenience, the 2013 Fusion
Hybrid battery has been moved to the floor
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.349
of the trunk, so
it won't block the pass through.
00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:47.900
And there's a clip that holds
your safety belts in place, so
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.305
they won't get caught behind
when folding your seat back.

00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:08.220
Is there any way to keep
my trailer from swaying?
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.310
&gt;&gt; Is there any way to reduce
the sway from my trailer?
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.510
&gt;&gt; For those of you who like to tow,
Ford has something that can help reduce
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.330
how much your trailer sways
while you are driving.
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.180
Here's how it works.
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.060
If your trailer starts to sway, you'll see
the stability control light flash, and
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.150
a trailer sway reduce speed message
in your information display.
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.380
The trailer sway controller feature
will begin to apply the brakes to
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.210
individual wheels, and
reduce your engine power if needed.
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.800
If this happens, it's likely that
your trailer is improperly loaded, or
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.620
the speed of your vehicle and
trailer are too high.
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.960
Slow down, pull your vehicle off the road,
and make sure that
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.270
your trailer is connected correctly and
your load is distributed properly.
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.250
Then drive at a slower speed than
you were before the sway occurred.
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.300
And here's something
else you need to know.
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.173
Trailer sway control will not affect how
your vehicle handles in normal driving
00:01:00.173 --> 00:01:02.725
conditions, or
when you're not towing a trailer.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:10.110
Your vehicle may be equipped with
inflatable rear outboard safety belts.
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.222
They work similarly to standard
belts in everyday use.
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.254
But in the event of an accident
they work a little differently.
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.647
Let me explain.
00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:22.222
Unlike a standard safety belt the
inflatable outboard rear safety belt uses
00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.303
two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081
To fasten it, just grab the tongue, that's
the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
And that it inflates properly if needed.
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.316
If you're in an accident, the crash system
in your vehicle will determine when, and
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.496
If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149
expand across the passengers' bodies to
distribute the forces from the crash over
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.551
a larger area to reduce
the risk of injury.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.176
if, the inflatable rear
safety belts should deploy.
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:56.496
If they're needed, the air bags will
inflate with cold, compressed gas and
00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.149

distribute the forces from the crash over
00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.551

two retractors.
00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:25.981
One for your torso and one for your lap.
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.081
To fasten it, just grab the tongue, that's
the part that connects the torso and
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:30.820
lap portion.
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.081
Pull the entire belt over your body at the
same time, then latch it into the buckle.
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.196
Make sure to insert the tongue in
a straight-in motion to the buckle.
00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.434
This will help ensure
the inflation mechanism lines up.
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.869
